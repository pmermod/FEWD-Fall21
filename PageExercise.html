          <h4>Labrador Retriever</h4>

          <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly,
            outgoing,
            and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a
            medium-to-large dog.</p>
          <p>The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at
            the
            shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious
            chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to
            be
            forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable
            housemates
            who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't
            mistake
            his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise,
            like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</p>

          <h4>German Shepard</h4>
          <img
            src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-origin-etr.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/12213218/German-Shepherd-on-White-00.jpg"

        </div>
        <div class="dogbody">
          <p>Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile,
            muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German
            Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.</p>
          <p> German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents
            a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they
            can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in
            the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage,
            confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line
            in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the
            breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate
            friendships.</p>

          <h4>Bulldog</h4>
          <img src="https://dogsbestlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/English-bulldog-scaled.jpeg" width="100">
        </div>
        <div class="dogbody">
          <p>Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser
            whose 'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. These docile, loyal companions adapt
            well to town or country.</p>
          <p>You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose,
            small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all
            practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth,
            and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at
            least trying to. But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need
            regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an
            air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.</p>
